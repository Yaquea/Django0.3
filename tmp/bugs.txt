Actual bugs:

The session token is getting kicked after 30 seconds. -fixed it was a config from the middleware
The authorization token is invalid, which makes the API request useless. -fixed just use another type of authorization on postman
The resend verification email is not working. (idk why resend verification email require begin a user logged)
Sometimes, the session token expires the second we log in. (idk)
